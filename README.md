Machine Learning Approach to Predicting COVID-19 Cases in Ohio State


This project proposes a machine learning approach to predict covid-19 cases by using a time series data of Ohio county in the initial weeks of outbreak to train the model. It also aims to explore relation between various social awareness features derived by the tweet data and case prediction. We compared the performance of myriad machine learning models such as Linear Regression, XGboost, Random Forest and Decision Tree and selected the best performed model on R2 metric. The feature engineering and modelling used in this can help policy makers and health officials to make informed decision and take early steps to tackle the pandemic.
